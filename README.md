## Description

It`s quite simply a Portfolio page built using Vanilla JS and styled using Bootstrap and Sass w/BEM-methodology.

My main focus was to make it easy to update the page without the need for additional design conciderations, so most of the content is updated through a JSON-file. I also wanted to make the impression that I`m more of a code-focused developer, than Design-focused.

This project was the first single-paged project I made using Scroll-Spy. Scroll-Spy makes the Navbar stick to the top when you have scrolled passed the intro, and it also controls which menu item is the active one.

Some features:

- Vanilla JS, BootStrap and Sass w/BEM
- Scroll-Spy controls the Navbar
- Easy content-updated through JSON-file
- Single Page Design
- Contact Form sends Email w/SmtpJS
